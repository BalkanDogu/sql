**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

In my previous workplace, it was common practice to conduct interviews with staff members whenever allegations or pertinent information about them surfaced. These interviews were part of our commitment to maintaining transparency and accountability within the organization. One day, I found myself in a particularly challenging situation when I received notice that my close friend, was to be interviewed.

Despite having access to the information regarding the allegations against him, I made a conscious decision not to delve into it. The ethical implications weighed heavily on me. I wanted to respect both our professional process and my integrity. It was crucial to avoid any conflict of interest or the appearance of bias. Thus, I refrained from accessing the details, hoping to maintain a fair and unbiased stance.

Later that day, my friend approached me with evident concern. "I got a notice for an interview tomorrow. Do you know anything about it?" he asked. I said "I don't have any information. You'll find out when you arrive." It was a difficult moment, balancing my role as a friend with my professional responsibilities, but I knew it was the right approach.

My friend attended the interview the next day, and although he was initially frustrated by my lack of information, he later understood the importance of my position. By respecting the boundaries of confidentiality and fairness, I preserved the integrity of our workplace process and, ultimately, our friendship. This experience reinforced my belief in the importance of maintaining ethical standards and professionalism, even when personal relationships are involved.
